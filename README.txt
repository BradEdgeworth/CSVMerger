# Overview
A python script to read a set of CSV files (that the script is launched from), read all of the column headers, and put into a master column header list.   Then it will consolidate allof the other rows from the CSV files, and insert into the appropriate rows. 

This tool was created to assist with Configuration CSVs. 


# Use

Running CSV-Merge.py queries local directory for all CSVs (except those that start with consolidate)
